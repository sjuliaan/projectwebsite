                            <strong>Foundation</strong>  is a sci-fi TV series based on Isaac Asimov's iconic book series. The show, produced by Apple TV+, follows the story of mathematician Hari Seldon, who develops a predictive science called psychohistory. Using this, he foresees the inevitable fall of the Galactic Empire and sets out to create the Foundation, an organization meant to preserve knowledge and minimize the period of chaos that follows.

                            The series spans multiple timelines and characters, including Seldon's followers, the rulers of the Empire (the Cleons), and various factions vying for control of the galaxy. It explores themes of fate, free will, and the struggle between order and entropy. With stunning visuals, deep philosophical undertones, and complex political intrigue, Foundation brings Asimov’s visionary work to life.
