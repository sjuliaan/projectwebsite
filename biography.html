                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
                <sup><b>1</b></sup> I am <strong>Seth Juian B. Cammayo</strong>, born in Ilagan, Isabela, where life was simple and full of adventure. 
                <sup><b>2</b></sup> As a child, I spent most of my days playing outside with friends, exploring the streets, and riding bicycles until sunset. 
                <sup><b>3</b></sup> My parents encouraged my curiosity, which led to a deep interest in technology. 
                <sup><b>4</b></sup> I remember dismantling toys to see how they worked, often struggling to put them back together. 
                <sup><b>5</b></sup> My early education was filled with excitement as I eagerly absorbed new knowledge. 
                <sup><b>6</b></sup> While I didn’t particularly enjoy mathematics and science, a computer subject fueled my passion for computers. 
                <sup><b>7</b></sup> I was fascinated by how a single click could perform tasks. 
                <sup><b>8</b></sup> Family gatherings were lively, filled with laughter, delicious food, and storytelling. 
                <sup><b>9</b></sup> Every summer, we visited my grandparents in the province, where I experienced a slower, more peaceful way of life. 
                <sup><b>10</b></sup> Those childhood moments shaped my values and taught me the importance of family, hard work, and perseverance. 
                <sup><b>11</b></sup> My love for technology started when I began playing PlayStation, fueling my curiosity about how games were created. 
                <sup><b>12</b></sup> This curiosity led me to explore computers, and I would often visit our computer shop just to play. 
                <sup><b>13</b></sup> I spent hours experimenting with programs, sometimes breaking them and asking for help to fix them. 
                <sup><b>14</b></sup> My parents noticed my passion and allowed me to explore computers freely. 
                <sup><b>15</b></sup> Eventually, I became comfortable navigating systems and learning how applications worked. 
                <sup><b>16</b></sup> My fascination grew stronger when I discovered the internet and its endless possibilities. 
                <sup><b>17</b></sup> Even as a child, I knew I wanted to be involved in something related to computers. 
                <sup><b>18</b></sup> <em>The joy of learning</em> something new and applying it to real-life situations became my motivation. 
                <sup><b>19</b></sup> Technology felt like an infinite world waiting to be explored, and I was motivated to dive into it. 
                <sup><b>20</b></sup> Looking back, those formative years set the foundation for my journey into technology and shaped my ambition for the future.
